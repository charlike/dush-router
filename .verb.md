_You might also be interested in [dush-no-chaining][], [dush-methods][] and [dush-tap-report][], 
a plugins for [dush][] microscopic event emitter with simple & powerful plugin system._

## Highlights :sparkles:
- **Small:** Really small and lightweight
- **Easy:** Regex-based routing, for simple cases
- **Extensible:** Can use [path-match][] under the hood
- **Isomorphic:** For the browser or Node.js >= v0.10
- **Customize:** Control over route handler's arguments
- **Great:** Sane and good defaults, but easy to customize
- **Simple:** Based on awesome event system like [dush][]
- **Stable:** Well tested, with [400% coverage](./package.json#L55-L61)
- **Modern:** Plays well with [nanomorph][], [bel][] or any other thing
- **Allows:** Adding multiple handlers on same route

## Notes

### About "on route"

You can customize everything. By default, we call the route handler with single "context" object
which contains `.route`, `.pathname`, `.params` and `.state` properties.

- `route` - the route of the handler, e.g. `/user/:id`
- `pathname` - the incoming url - 1st argument of `.navigate` method, e.g. `/user/charlike`
- `state` - optional "state" for the page - 2nd argument of `.navigate` method, e.g. `{ foo: 1 }`
- `params` - object, containing the params of the route, e.g. `{ id: 'charlike' }`

But instead of this you may want to pass more additional arguments to route handler or include 
only few of these above. To do this you can `off` the default `.on('route')` logic and provide
a new logic. The listener of `route` event will be passed with `(handler, context, el)` signature.
Where `handler` is the route handler function, `context` is the above context object, and `el` can be
the "previous" returned value of the handler call (it is useful for diffing).

In above API docs have existing example, but let's try it again.

```js
// remove the defafult
app.off('route')
```

Okey, let's say we want our route handlers to have `(params, actions)` signature.
We can get the first from the "context" object, but what about "actions". Let's think
 of the route handler as _"view"_, so we want to pass some actions to be done on some scenario.

> _**Tip:** This is the perfect place to plug in a virtual or real dom diffing algorithm! You
definitely should try to use [nanomorph][] here to see the magic! :)_ 

```js
const actions = {
  hi: (name) => alert('hi ' + name)
}

app.on('route', (handler, context) => {
  return handler(context.params, actions)
})
```


Now, let's define our simple view with [bel][], a simple DOM builder using tagged template strings.

```js
const html = require('bel')

app.addRoute('/hello/:name', (params, actions) => {
  return html`<div>
    <h1>Hello ${params.name}</h1>
    <button onclick=${() => actions.hi(params.name)}>Click me to alert you</button>
  </div>`
})
```

This view just outputs one heading and a button, which when is clicked will say "hi" to different persons,
based on the passed url, which in our case will be fired with `.navigate` method.

```js
const res = app.navigate('/hello/charlike')

console.log(res) // => DOM element
console.log(res.toString())
// =>
// <div>
//   <h1>Hello charlike</h1>
//   <button>Click me to alert you</button>
// </div>
```

And because `.navigate` method returns what is returned value from the matched route, we can
easy get the rendered page.

### About routing

By default we use _really simple_ approach for covering most common and simple cases. It is similar
to what we see in Express app's routing, where `:name` is a placeholder for some param.

But because everything is some simple, small and pluggable, you can create another plugin
that provide a different `.createRoute` method, for example using [path-match][]. There's 
only few things that you should follow and they can be seen in the source code, 
it is pretty small and easy to understand.

## Contributing
Pull requests and stars are always welcome. For bugs and feature requests, [please create an issue](https://github.com/{%= repository %}/issues/new).  
Please read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for advice on opening issues, pull requests, and coding standards.  
If you need some help and can spent some cash, feel free to [contact me at CodeMentor.io](https://www.codementor.io/tunnckocore?utm_source=github&utm_medium=button&utm_term=tunnckocore&utm_campaign=github) too.

**In short:** If you want to contribute to that project, please follow these things

1. Please DO NOT edit [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [.verb.md](.verb.md) files. See ["Building docs"](#building-docs) section.
2. Ensure anything is okey by installing the dependencies and run the tests. See ["Running tests"](#running-tests) section.
3. Always use `npm run commit` to commit changes instead of `git commit`, because it is interactive and user-friendly. It uses [commitizen][] behind the scenes, which follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.
4. Do NOT bump the version in package.json. For that we use `npm run release`, which is [standard-version][] and follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.

Thanks a lot! :)

## Building docs
Documentation and that readme is generated using [verb-generate-readme][], which is a [verb][] generator, so you need to install both of them and then run `verb` command like that

```
$ npm install verbose/verb#dev verb-generate-readme --global && verb
```

_Please don't edit the README directly. Any changes to the readme must be made in [.verb.md](.verb.md)._

## Running tests
Clone repository and run the following in that cloned directory

```
$ npm install && npm test
```
